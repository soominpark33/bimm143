# Importing candy data

```{r}
candy_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)

```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

There are 85 candy types in the dataset. 

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

There are 38 fruity candy types in the dataset. 

# What is your favorite candy?

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

My favorite candy is Kit Kat and its winpercent is 76.7686

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```


> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

the skimr::skim() function

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```


> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The "winpercent" column seems to be on a different scale than the other columns.


> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

A zero in the candy$chocolate column represents that the candy does not contain chocolate, and one represents that it contains chocolate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution of winpercent values seems slightly skewed to the right. 

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
median(candy$winpercent)
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

The center of the distribution is below 50%. 

> Comparison between chocolate and fruity candies

```{r}
chocolate_winpercent <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
fruity_winpercent <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
chocolate_mean <- mean(chocolate_winpercent)
chocolate_mean

fruity_mean <- mean(fruity_winpercent)
fruity_mean
```

Chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruity candy on average. 

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(chocolate_winpercent, fruity_winpercent)
```

Based on the p-value of the t-test, this is statistically significant. 

# Overall Candy Rankings.

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent), ], n = 5)
```

The least liked candies are Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE), ], n = 5)
```

The Top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set are Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and Snickers. 

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill = "gray")
```

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```


> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

# Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```


> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Fruity + chocolate

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

chocolate + winpercent or chocolate + bar

# Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

plot our main PCA score plot of PC1 vs PC2

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])

p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

pc <- as.data.frame(pca$x)
  p <- ggplot(pc) +
    aes(PC1, PC2, label = rownames(pc)) +
    geom_point(col = my_cols) +
    geom_text_repel(col = my_cols, max.overlaps = 5)
  p
```

```{r}
#library(plotly)

#ggplotly(p)
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard and pluribus
