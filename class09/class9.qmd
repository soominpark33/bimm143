# Protien Data Bank (PDB) Statistics

The PDB is the main database for structural information on biomolecules. Let's see what it contains:

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
db
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
# remove commas 
gsub("," , "", db$X.ray)
# convert character to numeric
as.numeric(gsub("," , "", db$X.ray))
# find the sum
sum(as.numeric(gsub("," , "", db$X.ray)))

xray.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub("," , "", db$X.ray)))
print(xray.total)
em.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub("," , "", db$EM)))
print(em.total)
```

Hmm... I am doing the same thing over and over. Time to write a function.

```{r}
# I will work with 'x' as input and make a working snippet. 

x <- db$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(gsub("," , "", x)))

# Code > Extract Function 

sum_comma <- function(x) {
  # Substitute the comma and convert to numeric 
  sum(as.numeric(gsub("," , "", x)))
}
```

```{r}
# Test the function
sum_comma(db$X.ray)
sum_comma(db$Total)
```

Now we can use the function to find the percentage of structures solved by X-ray

```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total) * 100
```

For Electron Microscopy:

```{r}
sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma(db$Total) * 100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
# find the total number of protein and remove comma. (There are two ways)
sum_comma(db[1, 8])
sum_comma(db$Total[1])

sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total) 

# round  the number
round(sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to see Hydrogen.

> Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working with Structures in R (Introduction to Bio3D in R)

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb

```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2


```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis)

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" of the motion for viewing in MolStar 

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
